<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">We cannot guarantee that there will be no other possibility of disclosing your personal communications and other information as mentioned otherwise in this Privacy Policy due to the current and time to time newly implemented regulatory policies. For instance, we might be compelled to provide information to the government, law enforcement, or other parties (without limiting or forgoing it). In some cases, members may abuse or misuse the data they gather from our website, or third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, even while we use industry-standard practices to protect your data, we cannot and should not assume that your personal information, identifiable information, or private communications will always remain private. Our company policy prohibits us from renting or selling any information about you to any third party. However, the following outlines specific ways in which you can divulge your personal data: External service providers: Our websites work with a number of services provided by outside vendors. Their privacy policy will be applicable when you use these optional services and they need to gather data from you. Other corporate entities include: Your personal information is shared with our parent company and/or subsidiaries so they can assist you with your online needs and provide you with ancillary services that are offered globally. You will receive these details only to enhance your browsing experience and to offer our services. As long as they have access to your information, they will treat it similarly to how they treat the information of their other members. The company, one or more of its subsidiaries, or all of them, maybe bought out by or combined with another company. If the package of services you requested was not something we could provide on our own servers, we might disclose part or all of your personal information. In the case that this occurs, you will be informed (to the extent that it occurs). To ensure the enforcement of numerous laws, including those pertaining to intellectual property, fraud, and other property rights, we collaborate with a number of other organizations, including law enforcement.

<p class="p4">Every time you register, you can access and modify the data you provide. We can examine your past data to see if there have been any alterations. Your personal information, like your address, postcode, nation, and phone number, are all editable. In some circumstances, such as when it would be necessary to have a copy of the information to resolve disputes, or issues, or to comply with our terms and conditions, we may store copies of the information you ask us to delete. Further concern is that because of technical and legal limitations, including storage backups, obsolete data will never been be totally erased from our system. You shouldn't anticipate us completely deleting all of your personally identifiable data from our database in order to comply with your request and our policy.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Other Information Collection vis Third Party</strong></li>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li3"><strong>Disputes, Arbitration and Jurisdiction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4">A two-step alternative dispute resolution procedure will be used to settle all claims raised under this policy, including but not limited to claims about rights, refunds, and compensation. We shall always prompt for amicable settlement at the first stage. If a disagreement emerges, a neutral third party will be selected to resolve it, and each party will choose a mediator based on mutual consent. If both parties accept the single arbitrator proposed by either party, that individual will be tasked with mediating the dispute. However, the corporation has the right to make the final choice if the two suggested mediators are unable to come to an agreement. Despite the fact that the mediator's judgment is not legally enforceable, both parties will make every effort to comply with it. The arbitration process is the second stage. The arbitration award is final and enforceable by both parties if the mediation is unsuccessful. One arbitrator will be chosen by each party, and the third will be chosen by two more arbitrators who have agreed to work together. The arbitration must take place at the capital city of Dhaka in Bangladesh. The language of the arbitration will be English. Both parties are required to abide by the arbitrator's ruling once it is rendered. If the disagreement cannot be resolved through an alternative dispute settlement, it would be brought before the jurisdiction court in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
